# **Pricing Derivatives with ML**  

## **Problem Statement**  
1. Develop a model to price derivatives in the most general form.  
   Key aspects:  
   - Multiple random cashflows  
   - Stochastic discount factors  
   - Early exercise possibility  
2. Explore the application of Reinforcement Learning:  
   - Derivatives with early redemption options  
   - Accounting for transaction costs  

## **Potential Approaches**  
1. General derivative pricing:  
   - Active learning  
   - Linearizing the derivative space and expressing complex derivatives through simpler ones  
2. Reinforcement Learning:  
   - Compare RL-based approaches with classical Monte Carlo algorithms  
   - Develop an agent to hedge derivatives while considering transaction costs
